Device Trust allows Teleport admins to enforce the use of trusted devices.
Resources protected by the device mode "required" will enforce the use of a
trusted device, in addition to establishing the user's identity and enforcing
the necessary roles. Furthermore, users using a trusted device leave audit
trails that include the device's information.
