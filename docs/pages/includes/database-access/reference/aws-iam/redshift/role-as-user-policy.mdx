| Statement | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
|`RedshiftConnectWithIAM` (required) | Connect to a Redshift database as a database user mapped 1:1 from this IAM identity. |

An IAM identity, such as a role, can connect as an automatically created
database user with permissions mapped 1:1 from the identity's IAM permissions.
Permissions in the database are granted with `redshift-data:*` statements
attached to the IAM identity, for example `redshift-data:GetStatementResult`.
Teleport users can connect as that role by specifying "role/{name}" as a
database user, e.g. `tsh db connect redshift-example-db --db-user=role/some-role-name`.

See
[Using identity-based policies for Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-identity-based.html)
for more information about available Redshift IAM permissions that are mapped
to the database user.
